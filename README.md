# Document Management System

A simple, open-source Document Management System built with FastAPI and React. This repository is intended as a beginner-friendly project for open-source contributions.

## 🌐 Live Demo

Try DocVault online:

- **Frontend:** https://doc-vault-lac.vercel.app
- **Backend API:** https://docvault-backend-iv5x.onrender.com
- **API Documentation:** https://docvault-backend-iv5x.onrender.com/docs

The frontend is deployed on Vercel, and the FastAPI backend is hosted on Render.

**Note:** The backend may take a little time to respond after a period of inactivity. Please allow a few seconds for it to wake up.



## Features

- **User Authentication:** Register and log in securely with JWT
- Upload and manage personal documents (up to 10MB)
- Readable document sizes in B, KB, or MB using 1024-based units (up to two decimal places, without trailing zeros); zero-byte files show `0 B` and invalid sizes show `Unknown`
- Documents and folders are completely private to the owner
- Download documents
- Delete documents
- Create and delete folders
- Rename folders with validation that preserves your input on errors
- Search documents by filename

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Alembic
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Axios

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 22.12+ (or Node.js 20.x starting at 20.19)
- PostgreSQL

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DocVault.git
cd DocVault
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Configure PostgreSQL:
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running.
- Create a database (e.g., `document_manager`).

Set up Python environment and run:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file and set your DATABASE_URL
copy .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your PostgreSQL credentials

# Run database migrations to create tables
alembic upgrade head

# Start the application
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The React application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Folder names

Folder creation and renaming trim leading and trailing whitespace and reject empty
or whitespace-only names. Names must be unique for each user (case-sensitive).
Folders are currently a flat list, so there is no parent-folder scope. Different
users can use the same folder name.

Use the pencil button beside a folder to rename it, then choose **Save** or
**Cancel**. Validation errors appear beside the input without clearing your text.
Renaming keeps the folder's documents and current selection unchanged.

The API accepts `PATCH /folders/{folder_id}` with `{"name": "New name"}` and requires
authentication as the folder owner. Invalid names return `422`, duplicate names
return `400`, and missing folders or folders owned by another user return `404`.

## Audit log

Sensitive document actions are recorded so users can see what happened to their
files. Document **upload**, **download** and **delete** each create an audit event
containing the actor, action, target (type, id and file name), client IP and
timestamp. Passwords, tokens and document contents are never stored. Failed
requests (for example a download of a missing document) are not recorded.

`GET /audit/` returns the authenticated user's own events, newest first, and
supports `limit` (1-500, default 100) and `offset` query parameters. Users can
only read their own events; unauthenticated requests return `401`. In the web
app, open the **Audit Log** panel from the header.

Run `alembic upgrade head` to create the new `audit_logs` table. Share creation
and revocation events will be added together with the document sharing feature.

## Running tests

From `backend`, with your virtual environment activated:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Backend tests use an isolated in-memory SQLite database and do not require a
running PostgreSQL instance or modify your development database.

From `frontend`:

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Frontend Checks

From the repository root:

```bash
npm ci --prefix frontend
node --test frontend/src/formatFileSize.test.js
npm run build --prefix frontend
npm run lint --prefix frontend
```
